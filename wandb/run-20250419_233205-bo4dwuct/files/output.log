[34m[1mwandb[39m[22m: [33mWARNING[39m The save_model argument by default saves the model in the HDF5 format that cannot save custom objects like subclassed models and custom layers. This behavior will be deprecated in a future release in favor of the SavedModel format. Meanwhile, the HDF5 model is saved as W&B files and the SavedModel as W&B Artifacts.
